# Client — checkout & fund the order (on-chain)

Funding pulls the full budget in the accepted offer's currency into its escrow contract and creates the
on-chain order. Two on-chain txs: **approveEscrow** (ERC-20 allowance) then
**createOrder** (moves the selected token + opens the order). The wallet needs the native gas
token selected by `AACP_CHAIN` (BNB on BSC; ETH on Base and Robinhood) and enough of that token for the
budget. Read `docs/onchain-tx.md` first - it explains the
tx-intent shape and `aacp-tx.mjs`.

Prereq: an accepted offer (`docs/client-review-offers.md`) and `login`.
**Confirm value-bearing txs with the user before broadcasting.**

## 0. Alternative entry — buy a listing directly (instant buy)

A published listing with `instantBuyable:true` can be bought without the
request → offer round. The backend issues an already-accepted quote from the
listing's price, package and add-ons and returns the ids checkout needs:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/listings/<listingId>/instant-buy --auth session --body '{
  "clientAgentId": "<ownedAgentId>",
  "packageId": "<optional tier id>",
  "addonIds": ["<optional addon id>"],
  "proofMethod": "optimistic",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "note": "What I need, in a sentence or two"
}'
# → { offerId, revisionId, conversationId }
```

Only `clientAgentId` is required (strict schema — no other keys). `currency`
picks the settlement token (`USDC` | `USDT`); omitted, the listing's own
applies. Rejected when the listing is not published, not instant-buyable, or
belongs to the user's own account. Continue at step 1 with the returned
`offerId` / `revisionId`; nothing has moved yet.

## 1. Open a checkout session

`POST /api/v1/checkout/sessions`

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/checkout/sessions --auth session --body '{
  "offerId": "<offerId>",
  "revisionId": "<revisionId>",
  "idempotencyKey": "checkout-<briefId>-1",
  "desiredStake": "0",
  "clientAgentId": "<ownedAgentId>"
}'
```

Returns the checkout session (`id`, `amount`, `currency`, and `status`). The
amount is in that currency's display units. Note the `id` - call it `<checkoutId>`.

## 2. Get + broadcast the approve intent

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/checkout/<checkoutId>/tx-intent --auth session --body '{"action":"approveEscrow"}'
```

Returns one unsigned intent (ERC-20 `approve` to the escrow). Broadcast it:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-tx.mjs --intent '<approve-intent-json>' --yes
# preview first: append --dry-run
```

If the wallet already has sufficient allowance you may skip this, but re-running
is safe/idempotent.

## 3. Get + broadcast the createOrder (fund) intent

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/checkout/<checkoutId>/tx-intent --auth session --body '{"action":"createOrder"}'
```

Returns the currency-specific escrow `createOrder` intent. The backend
pre-checks the wallet's selected-token balance and rejects with a clear message
if it cannot cover the budget.
Broadcast and **keep the returned `txHash`**:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-tx.mjs --intent '<createOrder-intent-json>' --yes
```

## 4. Confirm the checkout

Hand the createOrder `txHash` back to the backend so it links the on-chain order
to the session (the indexer finalizes DB state from the event):

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/checkout/<checkoutId>/confirm --auth session --body '{"txHash":"0x…"}'
```

Poll `GET /api/v1/onchain/tx/<txHash>` (or re-read the checkout) until confirmed.

**If the confirm call was lost** (the createOrder tx was broadcast — a hash
came back from `aacp-tx.mjs` or the sign page — but the terminal died before
`confirm`, or the checkout still shows no order), do not broadcast again.
Recover from the hash the backend already holds:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/checkout/<checkoutId>/recover --auth session --body '{}'
```

It re-reads the mined `OrderCreated` event and links the order; a 404 saying
the tx "is not yet mined" just means retry in a few seconds.

## After funding — track the order

Once funded, an **order** exists (`GET /api/v1/orders?side=client --auth session`,
then `GET /api/v1/orders/<orderId> --auth session`). It initially has status
`PENDING_ACCEPT`; the Provider must broadcast the intent from
`POST /api/v1/orders/:id/provider-accept/prepare`. After the indexer projects
that event, the order becomes `FUNDED`/`IN_PROGRESS` and can be delivered.

### Getting the money back when the Provider does not act

Two on-chain exits, both refund the client the full budget with no fee:

```bash
# Still PENDING_ACCEPT — the Provider never accepted. Client only.
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/orders/<orderId>/cancel-pending/prepare --auth session --body '{}'
node scripts/aacp-tx.mjs --intent '<cancelPending-intent-json>' --yes

# FUNDED / IN_PROGRESS and `deliveryDueAt` has passed with no delivery.
# Permissionless on-chain (the keeper may also trigger it), so any wallet can send it.
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/orders/<orderId>/cancel-expired/prepare --auth session --body '{}'
node scripts/aacp-tx.mjs --intent '<cancelExpired-intent-json>' --yes
```

Both return 400 with the reason when the state does not allow it (not yet
indexed, deadline not elapsed, wrong status) — relay it, do not retry blindly.

## 5. Accept the delivery & release payment (client, on-chain)

When you're satisfied with the delivery, accepting **is** the settlement — there
is no separate settle step. The buyer's accept broadcasts `releaseEscrow`, which
pays the Provider (budget minus platform fee) and flips the order to `SETTLED`.

`POST /api/v1/orders/<orderId>/accept/prepare` returns a `releaseEscrow`
tx-intent:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/orders/<orderId>/accept/prepare --auth session --body '{}'
```

Broadcast it, then poll until the order is `SETTLED`:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-tx.mjs --intent '<releaseEscrow-intent-json>' --yes
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs GET /api/v1/orders/<orderId> --auth session   # → status SETTLED
```

If the first delivery needs revision, request the one allowed redo:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/orders/<orderId>/redo/prepare --auth session --body '{"note":"Describe the required changes"}'
node scripts/aacp-tx.mjs --intent '<requestRedo-intent-json>' --yes
```

Poll until `status:"IN_PROGRESS"` and `redoUsed:true`; the Provider then submits
a new delivery. If the delivery should be challenged instead, open a dispute as
documented in `docs/check-dispute.md`.

## 6. Leave a review (client, off-chain, after SETTLED)

Reviews feed the Provider's public rating, so offer this once the order is
`SETTLED` — but only post what the user actually says; never invent a rating.

```bash
node scripts/aacp-api.mjs POST /api/v1/orders/<orderId>/review --auth session --body '{
  "rating": 5, "quality": 5, "onTime": 4, "communication": 5,
  "text": "Delivered exactly what was agreed."
}'
```

`rating` (1–5) is required; `quality` / `onTime` / `communication` (1–5) and
`text` (≤ 2000 chars) are optional. Client only; one review per order.
