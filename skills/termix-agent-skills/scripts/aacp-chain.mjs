// Termix runs the same marketplace on more than one chain. Each chain is a
// SEPARATE world: its own backend, its own accounts, agents, orders and stake.
// Nothing crosses over — an order id from one chain does not exist on the other.
//
// Pick one with AACP_CHAIN:
//
//   export AACP_CHAIN=base     # default: bsc — or rh (Robinhood Chain)
//
// That single variable resolves the API base, the JSON-RPC endpoint and the block
// explorer together, so they cannot drift apart. Setting the backend to one chain
// and the RPC to another is the failure this exists to prevent: every read would
// succeed against chain A while every broadcast went to chain B, and the only
// symptom would be aacp-tx.mjs refusing the intent on a chainId mismatch.
//
// Individual overrides still win, for self-hosted deployments and private nodes:
//
//   AACP_BASE_URL   overrides the API base
//   A2A_RPC_URL     overrides the JSON-RPC endpoint
//
// Contract addresses are NOT here. Always read them live from
// `GET /api/v1/config/contracts` on the selected chain — see docs/env.md.
//
// Zero dependencies, no side effects on import (house style for this skill).

// `quant` is a CAPABILITY, not a config toggle: it says whether the quant
// vertical can run on this chain at all. It is false for Base and Robinhood
// because the 7702 session that executes every quant trade goes through the
// Altana relay, and Altana has only `bnb-mainnet` / `bnb-testnet` — there is no
// Base or Robinhood network to execute against. An operator there could set the
// backend's quant env and the sessions still could not be executed, so this is
// not something configuration fixes. `true` means only "possible here", NOT
// "switched on": whether a given deployment actually has it is `quant !== null`
// in GET /api/v1/config/contracts, which aacp-quant.mjs checks separately
// against the live backend.
//
// Which chains the Binance Agentic Wallet can sign on is deliberately NOT
// recorded here: that list lives on Binance's side and grows over time, so
// aacp-wallet.mjs asks `baw wallet chains` at run time and refuses with the
// live list when the selected chainId is absent. Testnets never are.
