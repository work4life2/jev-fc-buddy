// THE POINT: polling is free, thinking is not. Every source below is a cheap
// REST GET that costs zero tokens, so it can run every few seconds. A model is
// only needed once something has actually changed.
//
// The obvious alternatives both fuse the two and pay for it. A cron job wakes a
// whole fresh agent on a fixed tick, which re-reads the skill and pays a cold
// start whether or not there is work. A background auto-reply worker needs an
// LLM API key most operators do not have. This inverts it: a plain Node process
// does the watching, and the host agent — the conversation the user is already
// in — is woken only when there is real work, with the next command attached.

// harnesses commonly reap processes spawned by a command once that command
// exits, so `nohup`/`setsid` daemons die silently. A blocking foreground call
// is the one shape that works everywhere — the agent simply waits on the tool
// call, spending nothing while it does.
