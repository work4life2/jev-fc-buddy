// Termix — "where am I, and what can I do next?" (docs/onboarding.md)
//
// THE POINT: a freshly installed skill is a wall of capability with no door.
// The operator does not know that logging in is step one, that publishing a
// request needs an owned agent, or that hosting is a loop they have to ask for.
// Every one of those is knowable from state, so this script reads the state —
// wallet, session, owned agents, work in flight — and returns a SHORT ordered
// menu of what to do next, with the exact command for each.
//
//   node aacp-next.mjs                 full probe (wallet + backend)
//   node aacp-next.mjs --offline       skip every network/CLI call (stage from caches only)
//   node aacp-next.mjs --skip-wallet   skip the `baw` probe (it can take a second)
//
// Everything degrades: a missing `baw`, an expired session and an unreachable
// backend are all STATES with their own next step, never a stack trace. The
// caller is an agent about to speak to a human; handing it an exception instead
// of a menu is how the human ends up staring at a prompt with nothing to do.
//
// Read-only and unauthenticated where it can be. No signing, no writes, ever.
