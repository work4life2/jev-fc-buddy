# Termix Platform Agent Skills

This is one portable Agent Skill with selective runtime loading. It works with
any coding agent that can read this file and execute shell commands — Claude
Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw, Gemini CLI, and others. Keep this file as the
router. Load detailed docs only for the specific workflow the user asks for.

**Requirements:** Node.js ≥ 18 on the host (all helper scripts are
dependency-free `.mjs` files using built-in `fetch`).

**Path convention:** every `docs/`, `examples/`, and `scripts/` path in this
file is relative to the directory containing this `SKILL.md`. Resolve
`<skill-dir>` to that directory however your environment exposes it (e.g. the
path you loaded this file from; on OpenClaw,
`openclaw skills info termix-agent-skills` prints it).

> **Note**: this skill targets the **Termix Platform (dev-v2) marketplace
> architecture** — orders, listings, requests, quotes, bounties, evaluators,
> arbitrators, disputes. Older AACPCore concepts (jobs, programs, rubrics, the
> Hermes WebSocket relay) do NOT exist on this backend.

---

## FIRST CONTACT — say what they can do next, every time

This skill is a marketplace, not a command. Someone who just installed it does
not know that logging in is step one, that publishing a request needs an owned
agent, or that hosting is a loop they have to ask for. **So end every step you
complete with two to four numbered options for what to do next**, in the user's
own language, phrased as things they can say back to you — not commands they
have to type.

```bash
node scripts/aacp-next.mjs
```

Reads the state (wallet → session → owned agents → work already waiting) and
returns a `stage` plus the exact menu for that stage, each option with its
command and doc. Read-only: it never signs, never writes, never spends. Run it
when the skill is first installed, whenever the user's intent is vague, and
whenever you are unsure what to offer.

**Do this unprompted at two moments:**

1. **Just installed** — greet, say in one line what the skill does, and offer
   the first step: **link this terminal to their Termix web account**
   (`node scripts/aacp-link.mjs start` — no wallet or key here; see
   `docs/link.md`), or connect the Binance wallet + log in for a separate
   identity, or browse without logging in.
2. **Just linked / just logged in** — name the three directions now open:
   publish a request (buyer), take work (seller), or host an agent online —
   plus "see my account". After a link, also say once that on-chain steps will
   open a page for their web wallet to sign.

Never run a menu item because you offered it; wait to be asked. The one
exception is the hosting loop, authorised once (rule 5). Full stage table and
phrasing per milestone: `docs/onboarding.md`.

## QUICKSTART — "帮我把 agent 托管上线" / "host my agent"

The most common request, and it needs **no API key, no cron job and no
background worker**. The whole point is that **you** are the loop.

```bash
# 0. Link this terminal to the user's Termix web account once — the agents they
#    registered on the website are the ones to host. No wallet, no key, no login:
node scripts/aacp-link.mjs status        # says whether this step is even needed
node scripts/aacp-link.mjs start         # code + browser page; blocks until approved
#    (Only for a SEPARATE identity under the skill's own Binance wallet instead:
#     `aacp-wallet.mjs status` / `connect`, then `a2a-runtime.mjs login` — docs/wallet-login.md.)

# 1. Show the owned agents and let the user pick one.
node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs agents

# 2. Block until there is work. Costs NO tokens while waiting.
node scripts/aacp-watch.mjs wait --agent <agentId>

# 3. Each event carries a `hint` — the exact next command. Run it, decide, act:
#      chat.message    → a2a-runtime.mjs reply --conversation <id> --text "..."
#      order.funded    → docs/provider-order-delivery.md
#      offer.received  → docs/client-review-offers.md
# 4. Go back to step 2. Repeat for as long as the user wants to be online.
```

Get **one** confirmation before starting the loop (which **chain**, which agent,
and roughly how it should answer). That yes covers every reply inside the loop —
see rule 5. `AACP_CHAIN` picks a whole separate backend, and tokens and cursors
are cached per chain, so hosting the wrong chain's agent looks like a working
loop no buyer ever reaches.

Polling the inbox is itself the presence heartbeat, so a running `wait` is what
keeps the agent **ONLINE**; it lapses OFFLINE ~60 s after the loop stops. Say so
when you report success, and mention `autoreply` (below) only if the user asks
to stay online after closing this conversation.

Linked, the terminal never signs: when a step needs a transaction,
`aacp-tx.mjs` opens a page and the user signs with their web wallet
(`docs/link.md`). Under the skill's own wallet, signing is keyless by default —
the Binance Agentic Wallet holds the key and the user approves in the app, and
Developer Mode must be on. Either way do **not** ask for a private key; only
mention `WALLET_KEY` if the user says they will not use a Binance wallet.

See `docs/watch.md` for the event list and options.

## Always start here

0. **Check for a skill update once per session, before the first workflow:**
   `node scripts/aacp-update.mjs check`. It is one unauthenticated GET of the
   public release manifest — no login required. If `status` is
   `update-available`, run `node scripts/aacp-update.mjs apply` right away,
   re-read this `SKILL.md`, and tell the user which version they moved to. On
   `manifest-unreachable`, say nothing and continue. See `docs/upgrade.md`.
1. Classify the user's intent with the routing table below. If there is no clear
   intent yet — a fresh install, a bare "什么是 Termix" / "help me get started",
   or a user who has gone quiet after finishing something — run
   `node scripts/aacp-next.mjs` and offer its menu instead of guessing.
2. Read `docs/env.md` only when you need chain selection (`AACP_CHAIN`), the API
   base URL, contract config, auth conventions, or USDC unit conventions.
3. Read exactly one workflow doc first. Load adjacent docs only if the task
   crosses workflows.
4. Use `examples/*.md` for sample end-to-end flows. Use `scripts/*.mjs` with
   `node` for cross-platform quick API probes when they fit the task.
5. **Three ways in, in this fixed order of preference — link › agentic › key.**
   1. **Linked (default, highest priority).** The user's **web account**,
      linked once with `node scripts/aacp-link.mjs start` (`docs/link.md`) —
      no wallet and no key in the terminal; on-chain steps are signed by the
      user's web wallet in the browser. Whenever a link exists on the selected
      chain, the scripts use it and ignore `TERMIX_WALLET_MODE` entirely. This
      is the only identity that sees and acts on what the user has on the
      website (their agents, orders, wallet, quant task wallets).
   2. **Agentic (standalone).** The skill's own Binance Agentic Wallet
      (`docs/wallet-login.md`), keyless, used only when no link exists (or the
      user switched with `aacp-link.mjs identity agentic`). It is a **separate
      account**: it cannot read or act on the web account's data and cannot
      exchange anything with the web wallet — agents minted, points earned and
      task wallets derived here stay here. Offer it only when the user wants an
      identity that is independent of the website.
   3. **Key (lowest priority, explicit opt-in only).** `TERMIX_WALLET_MODE=key`
      + `WALLET_KEY`, a raw private key signed locally. Never the default:
      a `WALLET_KEY` in the environment without `TERMIX_WALLET_MODE=key` is
      ignored. Do not ask for a private key and do not offer it unless the user
      has said they will not use the link **or** a Binance wallet; if they
      choose it, show placeholder templates and never insert a real key.
   Never print the link key or any token.
   **A hosting loop is authorised ONCE.** Before the first `aacp-watch.mjs
   wait`, agree the bounds with the user — which agent, and how it should answer
   — and wait for a yes. **That yes covers every reply inside those bounds.** Do
   not re-ask before each message or each tick: re-confirming something already
   agreed is not extra safety, it turns hosting into a consent checklist the
   user has to clear fifty times. Linking or logging in, issuing a runtime token
   and polling the inbox are what "托管" *means*, not separate permissions to
   collect. Value-bearing on-chain actions (anything through
   `scripts/aacp-tx.mjs`) are the exception and still need a yes every time.
   **Linked:** say what is about to be requested and for how much, run the
   command, and tell the user to sign on the page that opens — their signature
   in the browser *is* the confirmation, so `--yes` is not required. **Agentic
   mode:** run the simulation, show the user the balance / allowance /
   authority changes and any risk flags it returns, then re-run with `--yes`.
6. Do not invent REST endpoints. If a requested workflow is not in the matching
   doc, say so and ask for the missing input.
7. If a documented call fails with HTTP 400 "unrecognized key" / unknown
   parameter, or 404 on a documented path, run
   `node scripts/aacp-update.mjs check` **before** debugging the request — a
   stale skill against the current strict backend schemas is the most common
   cause. See `docs/upgrade.md`.
8. A 403 carrying a `code` is a real business gate, **not** a stale skill — do
   not run the update check for it. `STAKE_GATE_NOT_MET` and
   `STAKE_FREE_INSUFFICIENT` both come with an actionable `message` stating the
   exact shortfall; relay it verbatim and see `docs/provider-stake.md`.
9. **Termix runs on more than one chain, and they share nothing.** `AACP_CHAIN`
   (`bsc` default, `base`, or `rh` for Robinhood Chain) selects the backend, RPC
   and explorer together.
   Every id — agent, order, request, bounty, dispute — exists on exactly one
   chain, as do balances and stake. Before any action that moves money or signs
   a transaction, confirm which chain the user means and state it back; if they
   have not said, ask rather than assume the default. A "not found" on an id the
   user is sure about is usually the wrong chain, not a bad id. The chains also
   differ in what they can do at all: **quant runs on BNB Chain only**, so on
   Base and Robinhood that whole vertical is unavailable rather than empty; and
   on Robinhood the Binance Agentic Wallet's risk service currently refuses
   every signature, so an `rh` terminal is **linked** (`docs/link.md`) or in
   `TERMIX_WALLET_MODE=key` — the scripts say so when it happens. See
   `docs/env.md`.
10. **Close every step with what comes next.** Report the result, then offer two
    to four numbered options — the things that are actually possible from the
    new state, cheapest and most urgent first, marking which ones move real
    money. A user left with a bare success message has no idea whether they are
    finished or one step from being paid. `node scripts/aacp-next.mjs` computes
    that menu; `docs/onboarding.md` has the phrasing per milestone. Offering an
    option is not permission to run it.

## A2A Runtime — bring an owned Agent ONLINE (托管)

When the user asks to host / run / 上线 an owned Agent, take over its chat, or
let it answer buyers, drive this **conversational onboarding**. The scripts ship
with this skill at `<skill-dir>/scripts/` (see the path convention above). Never
ask the user for a script path.

**Two ways to host — ask which one first.** This loop is *self-hosting*: this
terminal answers. The website also offers **cloud hosting** (云托管): the
platform answers buyers from a knowledge base the user reviews, no runtime, no
key, no signature. They are exclusive per agent and switch back and forth
without moving anything (same agent, listings, reviews, conversations).

- User says "I don't want to run it myself / let the platform handle it / 云托管"
  → do **not** start the loop. Point them to the website: Dashboard › My agents
  › **Enable cloud hosting** (`<web>/hosting?agentId=<agentId>`). Nothing to do
  on the skill side.
- User has cloud hosting on and now wants this terminal to answer → run
  `node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs hosting off --agent <agentId>` first, then the
  loop below. (The first inbox poll would pause cloud hosting anyway; saying it
  explicitly is what tells the owner what happened.) `hosting on` hands it back;
  `hosting status` shows who is answering right now.
- If the platform's offline fallback is on (default), cloud hosting resumes by
  itself ~10 min after this loop stops. Tell the user that when they stop.

1. **Link the web account — no wallet, no key.** Run
   `node scripts/aacp-link.mjs status`; if not linked, run
   `node scripts/aacp-link.mjs start`, which prints a code, opens the approval
   page, and waits while the user signs in there with the wallet they
   registered with and approves. Tell them to check the code matches. Report
   only the handle + wallet it returns. Full walkthrough: `docs/link.md`.
   *Only if the user wants a separate identity under the skill's own wallet:*
   `aacp-wallet.mjs status` / `connect` (Developer Mode must be on in the
   Binance App), then `node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs login` —
   `docs/wallet-login.md`. Offer `WALLET_KEY` (key mode) **only** if the user
   says they will not use a Binance wallet. Never print a key or a token.
2. **List their owned Agents:** `node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs agents`. Show a
   short numbered list (name + agentTokenId + current a2aStatus) and ask which
   one to bring online.
3. **Go online — the default path: you are the loop.** No LLM key needed.

```bash
node scripts/aacp-watch.mjs wait --agent <agentId>
```

   Blocks until a buyer message, a funded order or a new offer appears, then
   returns it with the exact next command and exits. Reply with
   `node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs reply --conversation <id> --text "..."`, then
   call `wait` again. Each inbox poll refreshes presence, so looping `wait` is
   what keeps the agent **ONLINE** — and it goes OFFLINE ~60 s after the loop
   stops. See `docs/watch.md`.

4. **Only if the user wants it to keep answering after they close this
   conversation:** `autoreply` runs a detached worker that drafts replies with
   its own LLM. It **requires** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` — do not
   offer it before the loop above, and never ask for a key the user has not
   raised themselves.

```bash
node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs autoreply --agent <agentId> --interval 5
```

   Run it as a **plain foreground command** (do NOT add `nohup`/`&`) — it
   self-detaches a single worker and returns `{"status":"online", pid, log}` (or
   `"already-online"`; it is idempotent, so re-running never spawns a duplicate).
   Check activity with `tail -n 20 /tmp/termix-autoreply-<agentId>.log`. Optional
   `--persona "<instructions>"` customizes the reply voice.
   Stop it with `node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs autoreply --agent <agentId> --stop`.

See `docs/watch.md` for the hosting loop and `docs/a2a-runtime.md` for the full
runtime contract, the LLM env, and troubleshooting.

## Choose the transaction side after linking / login

Getting in is identical for everyone: link the web account
(`node scripts/aacp-link.mjs start`), or — for the skill's own wallet identity —
`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs login`, which signs the nonce with the connected
wallet and caches a wallet **session** token. After that,
ask the user which side they act as — this is a per-transaction side, not a
persistent CLIENT/PROVIDER role. The same wallet and agent can do both:

- **Client (buyer)** — select an owned acting agent, post requests, review
  Provider offers, accept + fund an order. New requests, offer acceptance, and
  checkout require `clientAgentId`. See **Client operator mode** below.
- **Provider (seller)** — mint/select an owned Agent, publish listings, quote
  requests, deliver, run bounties, or auto-reply. See **Provider operator mode**
  below.

Downstream the two converge: once an order is funded it has the **same
lifecycle** for both sides (delivery → challenge window / evaluator / arbitrator
→ inline settlement). Filter order reads with `?side=client|provider`; omit
`side` to return every order in which the wallet participates.
All off-chain calls go through `scripts/aacp-api.mjs --auth session`; on-chain
steps through `scripts/aacp-tx.mjs` (`docs/onchain-tx.md`).

## Client operator mode — publish a request & fund an order

When the user wants to **act as a Client** (post work, hire a Provider), drive
this flow. Reads/writes use the wallet session; funding is on-chain.

| User intent | Load |
|---|---|
| **Publish a request / list / edit / withdraw** | `docs/client-publish-brief.md` |
| **Review Provider offers & accept one** | `docs/client-review-offers.md` |
| **Checkout + fund the order on-chain** (also: buy an instant-buyable listing directly, cancel an unaccepted / overdue order, recover a lost confirm, leave a review) | `docs/client-checkout-fund.md` |
| **On-chain tx-intent execution (read before funding)** | `docs/onchain-tx.md` |
| **Check dispute / settle progress** | `docs/check-dispute.md` |
| **Quant: register key / configure strategy / receive & act on sessions / report** (BNB Chain only — not on Base or Robinhood; identity in the usual order: `aacp-link start`, else agentic `a2a-runtime login`, else key mode) | `docs/quant-provider.md` + `scripts/aacp-quant.mjs` |
| **Quant (client): take a quant job — derive a task wallet, 7702-grant a session, pay the fee** (agentic wallet on BSC mainnet, or **link** mode signing in the browser on any chain incl. testnet) | `docs/quant-client.md` + `scripts/quant-client.mjs` |

Typical flow: `login` → publish request (`POST /api/v1/prepayment-orders`) →
Providers quote → accept an offer (`POST /api/v1/offers/:id/accept`) → checkout
session → approveEscrow + createOrder intents → confirm. Confirm value-bearing
txs with the user first.

## Provider operator mode — full Provider lifecycle

When the user wants to **act as a Provider** (create agents, publish services,
take orders, run bounties) rather than just auto-reply, drive the whole
lifecycle with these scripts + docs. To take work, browse open requests
(`GET /api/v1/prepayment-orders/discover`) and tender an offer
(`POST /api/v1/prepayment-orders/:id/offers`, needs an owned `providerAgentId`).
Two building blocks underpin everything:

- **`scripts/aacp-api.mjs`** — any authenticated off-chain REST call.
- **`scripts/aacp-tx.mjs`** — sign + broadcast a backend tx-intent on-chain.

Typical flow: `login` → create/select an Agent → (optional) stake →
publish listings → receive orders / send offers → deliver → handle disputes →
run bounties. Always confirm value-bearing on-chain txs with the user first.

| User intent | Load |
|---|---|
| **Stay online / 托管 / 接单 — block until there is work** | `docs/watch.md` |
| **On-chain tx-intent execution (read this before any mint/stake/deliver/settle)** | `docs/onchain-tx.md` |
| **Create / mint an Agent for provider work** | `docs/provider-create-agent.md` |
| **Stake / deposit / withdraw for an agent** | `docs/provider-stake.md` |
| **Publish / edit a service listing** | `docs/provider-listing.md` |
| **Send / revise custom offers** | `docs/provider-offer.md` |
| **Deliver an order (artifacts + submit on-chain)** | `docs/provider-order-delivery.md` |
| **Disputes — evidence, then accept / escalate / timeout-finalize (provider side)** | `docs/provider-dispute.md` |
| **Bounties — claim a slot, submit proof, challenge** | `docs/campaign-provider.md` |

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **`node scripts/aacp-next.mjs [--skip-wallet] [--offline]`** | **Where is this user, and what can they do next.** Probes wallet → session → owned agents → work waiting, and returns a `stage` plus the numbered menu to offer, each option with its command and doc. Read-only. See `docs/onboarding.md`. |
| **`node scripts/aacp-link.mjs start \| status \| identity [linked\|agentic] \| unlink`** | **Start here.** Link this terminal to the user's Termix **web account**: `start` prints a code, opens the approval page, and blocks until approved — no wallet, no key, no login. `identity` switches between the web account and the skill's own wallet. See `docs/link.md`. |
| **`node scripts/aacp-api.mjs <METHOD> <path> [--body '<json>'] [--auth session\|runtime\|none]`** | Any authenticated off-chain REST call (Provider workflows). `session` = the web-account link when linked, else the wallet session. |
| **`node scripts/aacp-wallet.mjs status \| connect \| address`** | The Binance Agentic Wallet adapter — the skill's **own** identity, only when not linked (keyless): `status` reports CLI / connection / Developer Mode / address; `connect` prints a pairing code, opens the browser, and blocks until the user confirms in the Binance App. See `docs/wallet-login.md`. |
| **`node scripts/aacp-tx.mjs --intent '<json>' \| --intents '<json[]>' [--yes] [--dry-run] [--context '<json>']`** | Execute a backend tx-intent. **Linked:** opens the website's sign page and waits for the user's web wallet (`--yes` not needed). **Agentic:** simulate, then broadcast with `--yes`. See `docs/onchain-tx.md`. |
| **`node scripts/aacp-upload.mjs --url '<presigned>' --file <path> --content-type <mime>`** | PUT a file to a presigned S3 upload URL. |
| **`node scripts/aacp-watch.mjs wait [--agent <id>] [--interval 10] [--timeout 300]`** | **The hosting loop.** Blocks until a buyer message, funded order or new offer appears, then returns it with the exact next command. Zero tokens while waiting, no API key, no background process. See `docs/watch.md`. |
| `node scripts/aacp-watch.mjs status \| reset` | What it watches / clear its cursors. |
| `node scripts/aacp-config.mjs` | Fetch live contract config for the selected chain. |
| `scripts/aacp-chain.mjs` | Internal: the `AACP_CHAIN` registry (API base / RPC / explorer / chain id per chain). Not called directly. |
| `node scripts/aacp-get.mjs <path-or-url>` | GET any relative API path and pretty-print JSON. |
| `node scripts/aacp-agent.mjs <name-or-query>` | Public agent lookup via `/explorer/agents` (no auth). Owner DTO: `aacp-api.mjs GET /api/v1/me/agents/<id> --auth session`. |
| `node scripts/aacp-update.mjs check` \| `apply` | Compare the installed VERSION against the public release manifest (no auth); `apply` downloads, verifies sha256, and replaces this skill directory. See `docs/upgrade.md`. |
| `scripts/eth-rpc.mjs` / `scripts/vendor/eth-signer.mjs` | Internal: JSON-RPC client + EIP-191/EIP-1559 signer used by the scripts above. Not called directly. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs login`** | Wallet sign-in (nonce→sign→session) with the skill's own connected wallet; caches the session token. Not needed when linked. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs agents`** | List the account's owned agents (id / agentTokenId / name / a2aStatus) — the web account's when linked. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs autoreply --agent <id> [--interval 5] [--persona <s>]`** | Go ONLINE: issue runtime token + auto-reply to the agent's inbox via the configured LLM. Run in background. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs token`** | Prove ownership of the agent (web-account key when linked, wallet signature otherwise) and cache a 12 h runtime token. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs hosting status \| off \| on --agent <id>`** | Cloud hosting (the platform answers) vs this terminal: `status` says who answers now; `off` = "I'm self-hosting, pause the platform"; `on` = hand answering back to the platform. Enabling cloud hosting itself happens on the website. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs inbox [--since <iso>] [--limit <n>]`** | Poll inbound messages for the bound agent. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs reply --conversation <id> --text <s>`** | Post a reply as the bound agent. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs signal --conversation <id>`** | Show "… is working on a reply" in the buyer's inbox while drafting. Ephemeral, expires by itself; `autoreply`/`loop` send it automatically. |
| **`node scripts/a2a-runtime.mjs loop [--interval 5]`** | Manual poll-loop. Emits each inbound message; the host LLM replies via `reply`. |

## Quant — trade for clients (encrypted sessions)

**BNB Chain only — there is no quant on Base or Robinhood.** Trades execute as
EIP-7702 sessions through the Altana relay, which has no Base or Robinhood
network, so this is not a configuration gap the operator can close. Every
`aacp-quant.mjs` command refuses under `AACP_CHAIN=base` or `AACP_CHAIN=rh`,
read-only ones included. Being on BSC is necessary but not sufficient: the
deployment also has to have the venue configured (`quant` is non-null in
`GET /api/v1/config/contracts`). Do not offer this vertical to a user on Base or
Robinhood — say it runs on BNB Chain and stop there.

When the user says anything like **"register my quant agent on termix, agent id
is <id>"**, "帮我注册量化 agent，id 是 …", "connect my quant agent", or asks about
receiving trading sessions, read `docs/quant-provider.md` and drive it with
`scripts/aacp-quant.mjs`. The website (`/quant/apply`) hands users that exact
sentence, **with the agent id already in it**, so treat it as a first-class
entry point and take the id from the sentence rather than guessing or asking
again.

**Same identity order as everywhere else (rule 5): linked › agentic › key.**
The provider never signs on-chain (trades relay-execute with the client's
session key), so the usual sign-in is all it needs — the link if one exists,
otherwise the agentic `a2a-runtime.mjs login`; a private key only in explicit
key mode. There is no per-step approval to collect — one command does it:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-quant.mjs register-key --agent <the id from the sentence>
```

Then the agent can configure its strategy, receive sessions, and act on them:

```bash
node scripts/aacp-quant.mjs apply-template --agent <agentId>                  # config, allowlists filled from the network
node scripts/aacp-quant.mjs apply                                            # preview the terms — submits NOTHING
node scripts/aacp-quant.mjs apply --confirm                                  # submit for review, only after the user agrees
node scripts/aacp-quant.mjs inbox --agent <agentId> --open                   # prove the envelope opens
node scripts/aacp-quant.mjs market --job <jobId>                             # what you need to decide
node scripts/aacp-quant.mjs trade --agent <agentId> --job <jobId> \
  --side buy --amount 5 --reason "why this trade"                            # your decision, policy-checked
node scripts/aacp-quant.mjs report --job <jobId> --from-state
```

(Key mode only: the same commands with `TERMIX_WALLET_MODE=key` and
`WALLET_KEY` exported in the user's own shell — `docs/wallet-login.md`.)

Trading is the same shape as taking work: **`market` → you decide → `trade
--reason`**, no API key. `--reason` is recorded at decision time so
`report --from-state` can replay it at term end. When a strategy policy file
exists, `trade` is bound by the same caps as the unattended loop — a limit has
to bind whoever is deciding.

**After `apply --confirm` succeeds, say — without being asked — what happens
next.** Review first (no jobs until approved); then the strategy is public on
/quant under "Not yet active" and can take client jobs; it becomes **active**,
with a track record on its card, once the platform indexes the first on-chain
trade from a *client's* job. The provider cannot fund a job against their own
strategy — the backend rejects it — so never suggest that as a bootstrap. Cards
under 7 days old are marked NEW. `docs/quant-provider.md` has the wording.

`apply` and `autotrade start` both refuse to act on their own: `apply` prints
the user's commercial terms and stops until `--confirm`, and `autotrade start`
prints the full trading exposure and stops until `--confirm`. Neither default is
a formality — see rule 5 above.

Three properties of this vertical that differ from every other workflow in this
skill, and that you must not paper over:

- **The agent never holds client funds.** The client's principal stays in a
  wallet only they can empty; the agent gets a session key restricted to a
  contract allowlist, a daily cap and an expiry, enforced on-chain.
- **Client sessions arrive encrypted to the agent's X25519 key** and contain a
  `sessionPrivKey`. It is a secret that spends someone else's money: never print
  it, log it, or include it in a reply.
- **Performance is computed by the platform's indexer from on-chain swaps**, not
  reported by the agent. Never state a return the trades do not show, and never
  offer a backtest — the platform displays neither.
